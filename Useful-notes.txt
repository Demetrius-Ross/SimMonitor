ls /dev/ttyUSB*

minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyUSB0



Connect the Main ESP to the Raspberry Pi using the following wiring:

    TX of Main ESP → RX of Raspberry Pi (GPIO15).
    RX of Main ESP → TX of Raspberry Pi (GPIO14).
    GND → GND.


Use EPS Now


sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red

node-red

Access the Node-RED dashboard in your browser:

    URL: http://<raspberry-pi-IP>:1880
    Create a dashboard that visualizes the incoming data.



Updated Project Structure

    ESP-NOW Mesh Network:
        ESP boards communicate directly with each other and the main ESP using ESP-NOW.

    Main ESP to Raspberry Pi Communication:
        The main ESP is connected to the Raspberry Pi via UART (serial communication).
        The main ESP forwards all received data to the Raspberry Pi.

    Raspberry Pi as Central Processor:
        The Raspberry Pi processes the received data from the main ESP.
        Runs a real-time dashboard or alert system for monitoring status updates.


Components

    ESP Boards (Nodes):
        Monitor status indicators (Red, Blue, Green LEDs).
        Use ESP-NOW for peer-to-peer communication.
        Send data to a main ESP via ESP-NOW.

    Main ESP (Aggregator):
        Collects status data from all ESP boards in the mesh network.
        Relays the aggregated data to the Raspberry Pi via a serial connection.

    Raspberry Pi:
        Receives data from the main ESP via UART.
        Processes the data and displays it on a real-time dashboard or logs it for analysis.
